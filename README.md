CMPG224 Software Engineering Project 2025
Project Description
The Information Management System (IMS) project aims to develop a comprehensive, userfriendly software system for managing and organizing data within a specific domain. The
system will serve as a central repository for collecting, storing, retrieving, and analyzing
information. The primary goal is to support users in handling domain-specific information
efficiently and reliably, thereby improving data accessibility and decision-making processes.
Students must clearly define the chosen domain (e.g., educational institution, healthcare
facility, or inventory management system) in the initial proposal phase and justify its
relevance.
Objectives
▪ Develop a robust and scalable system capable of managing a substantial volume of
structured data.
▪ Design an intuitive user interface to support efficient data entry, retrieval, and
analysis.
▪ Implement data validation and security mechanisms to ensure data integrity and
confidentiality.
▪ Provide reporting and analytics capabilities to support informed decision-making.
▪ Incorporate role-based access control to manage user permissions and visibility.
▪ Ensure maintainability and modular design to support future updates or
enhancements.
Scope
The IMS will focus on the development of software to manage domain-specific data (e.g.,
student records, patient details, inventory items). Core functions such as data storage,
retrieval, access control, and reporting will be implemented. The scope excludes hardware infrastructure setup, third-party system integration (e.g., payment gateways, biometric
systems), and large-scale deployment.
Project Plan
The project plan should define:
Phases (e.g., planning, design, implementation, testing)
▪ Timelines and milestones
▪ Team roles and task assignments
▪ Resource allocation and risk management strategies
Tools such as Gantt charts, Trello, or GitHub Projects may be used to track progress.
Regular check-ins with the supervisor are required.
Requirements
A. Functional Requirements:
▪ User registration, authentication, and session management.
▪ Data entry, editing, deletion, and retrieval.
▪ Search functionality using various filtering criteria.
▪ Role-based access control for users such as administrators, staff, and
managers.
▪ Report generation (e.g., summaries, performance indicators).
▪ Data import/export in standard formats (e.g., CSV, PDF).
▪ Non-functional Requirements:
Performance: The system should handle queries with acceptable response times,
even with moderate to large datasets.
▪ Usability: The interface must be intuitive, with attention to navigation and
feedback.
▪ Security: Employ encryption for sensitive data and access control policies.
▪ Scalability: The system must accommodate increasing data volume and users.
▪ Reliability: Ensure consistent availability and data accuracy under normal
operating conditions.
Requirements Engineering
Students must identify requirements using appropriate techniques such as stakeholder
interviews, use case modeling, or surveys. All requirements should be documented in a
Software Requirements Specification (SRS) document, reviewed, and approved during the
analysis phase.
Design
The system architecture may adopt a layered approach such as MVC (Model-ViewController) or multi-tier (presentation, logic, and data layers), etc. Design considerations
should include:
▪ Database: Use normalization and indexing for efficient data management.
▪ UI/UX: Follow standard usability principles for accessibility and ease of use.
Modularity: Maintain separation of concerns to support code reuse and testability.
Deliverables for this phase include design diagrams (e.g., class diagrams, ERDs, UI
mockups) and a detailed design document.
Implementation
The system may be developed as a web or desktop application using appropriate tools and
frameworks (e.g., Python/Django, Java/Spring, C#/.NET, PHP/Laravel, etc.).
Students must:
Justify their choice of technology stack.
▪ Follow coding standards and document code where necessary.
▪ Use version control (e.g., GitHub) throughout development.
Testing
A structured test plan must be prepared, including:
▪ Unit, integration, and system testing.
▪ Usability testing with sample users.
▪ Security and performance tests where applicable.
▪ Use of both manual and automated testing tools is encouraged.
All test results must be documented and linked to requirements.
Collaboration and Communication
Effective teamwork is expected. Teams should:
Use shared platforms (e.g., Google Drive, Slack, Discord, WhatsApp, etc.) for
communication.
▪ Keep records of team meetings and decisions.
▪ Document contributions of each member for fair evaluation.
Evaluation and Grading
Projects will be assessed using a rubric covering the following:
▪ Problem understanding and planning.
▪ Requirements and design quality
▪ Functionality and usability
▪ Code quality and testing
▪ Teamwork and project management
▪ Final report, demonstration, and presentation
Peer assessments may be considered where appropriate.
Main Deliverables
▪ Project Proposal (with domain selection and justification) & Project Plan
▪ Software Requirements Specification (SRS)
▪ System Design Document (SDD) (with diagrams)
▪ Source Code and User Interface
▪ Test Plan and Test Results
▪ User Manual and Deployment Guide (Optional)
▪ Final Report and Presentation

The topic that we chose is COMMUNITY SERVICE VOLUNTEER TRACKING SYSTEM , Where the system will track volunteer tasks , hours and perticipation records.
